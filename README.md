# SortingAlgorithmSpeedTest
Made for COMP 2080 in my school program

Speed test of selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort in Java to see the differences between them - Based on sets of 50, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 from the same pool of random core data (integers)

Create a new project in any IDE you use for Java and copy over the .java files to the src (adding any package name for the project you create to the top of the two files)
